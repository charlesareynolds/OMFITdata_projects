COGENT workflow summary:

- SNAP file              -> EFIT       -> geqdisk file
- geqdisk_file           -> Hypnotoad  -> grid file,                            
                                          coeff file
- grid file,

                                          nodal coeff file
- nodal grid file,
  nodal coeff file       -> Fix X      -> fixed nodal grid file,
                                          fixed nodal coeff file
- fixed nodal grid file,

You can begin at any step.

The input and otput files are all in COGENT|FILES.

When you set filenames in the GUI use the simple name, e.g. 
fixed_nodal_grid_1, instead of 
/tmp/creyn/OMFIT/OMFIT_2015-04-14_10_55_23/file_2015-04-14__15:03:12__581108/fixed_nodal_grid_1.  
OMFIT adds the first part automatically.

A working copy of the project may be saved between steps with a date-time or 
otherwise unique name to come back to later.

To save the project after changes do File|Save As... because File|Save does NOT 
copy files back to your original project directory!
